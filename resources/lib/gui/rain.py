"""The live code rain: a scene the addon draws instead of playing a video.

Each column is two image controls stacked on top of each other. The lower one
is the light -- a bar of colour holding the raindrops -- and it scrolls
downwards on a looping slide animation. The upper one is the stencil: black
with the column's glyphs punched out of it, and it never moves, so the light
shows through in the shape of glyphs that stay where they are.

That leaves the skin engine to move a single control per column, which is why
the rain costs nothing per frame in Python.
